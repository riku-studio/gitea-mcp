## What is Gitea?

Gitea is a community-managed lightweight code hosting solution written in Go. It is published under the MIT license. Gitea provides Git hosting including a repository viewer, issue tracking, pull requests, and more.

## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a protocol that allows for the integration of various tools and systems through a chat interface. It enables seamless command execution and management of repositories, users, and other resources.

## 🚧 Installation

### Usage with Claude Code

This method uses `go run` and requires [Go](https://go.dev) to be installed.

```bash
claude mcp add --transport stdio --scope user gitea \
  --env GITEA_ACCESS_TOKEN=token \
  --env GITEA_HOST=https://gitea.com \
  -- go run gitea.com/gitea/gitea-mcp@latest -t stdio
```

### Usage with VS Code

For quick installation, use one of the one-click install buttons at the top of this README.

For manual installation, add the following JSON block to your User Settings (JSON) file in VS Code. You can do this by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + P` and typing `Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)`.

Optionally, you can add it to a file called `.vscode/mcp.json` in your workspace. This will allow you to share the configuration with others.

> Note that the `mcp` key is not needed in the `.vscode/mcp.json` file.

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "inputs": [
      {
        "type": "promptString",
        "id": "gitea_token",
        "description": "Gitea Personal Access Token",
        "password": true
      }
    ],
    "servers": {
      "gitea-mcp": {
        "command": "docker",
        "args": [
          "run",
          "-i",
          "--rm",
          "-e",
          "GITEA_ACCESS_TOKEN",
          "docker.gitea.com/gitea-mcp-server"
        ],
        "env": {
          "GITEA_ACCESS_TOKEN": "${input:gitea_token}"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 📥 Download the official binary release

You can download the official release from [official Gitea MCP binary releases](https://gitea.com/gitea/gitea-mcp/releases).

### 🔧 Build from Source

You can download the source code by cloning the repository using Git:

```bash
git clone https://gitea.com/gitea/gitea-mcp.git
```

Before building, make sure you have the following installed:

- make
- Golang (Go 1.24 or later recommended)

Then run:

```bash
make install
```

### 📁 Add to PATH

After installing, copy the binary gitea-mcp to a directory included in your system's PATH. For example:

```bash
cp gitea-mcp /usr/local/bin/
```

## 🚀 Usage

This example is for Cursor, you can also use plugins in VSCode.
To configure the MCP server for Gitea, add the following to your MCP configuration file:

- **stdio mode**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gitea": {
      "command": "gitea-mcp",
      "args": [
        "-t",
        "stdio",
        "--host",
        "https://gitea.com"
        // "--token", "<your personal access token>"
      ],
      "env": {
        // "GITEA_HOST": "https://gitea.com",
        // "GITEA_INSECURE": "true",
        "GITEA_ACCESS_TOKEN": "<your personal access token>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- **http mode**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gitea": {
      "url": "http://localhost:8080/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer <your personal access token>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Default log path**: `$HOME/.gitea-mcp/gitea-mcp.log`

> [!NOTE]
> You can provide your Gitea host and access token either as command-line arguments or environment variables.
> Command-line arguments have the highest priority

> [!NOTE]
> Many tools support `page` and `perPage` parameters for pagination. The maximum effective page size is determined by the Gitea server's `[api].MAX_RESPONSE_ITEMS` setting (default: **50**). Requesting a `perPage` value higher than this limit will be silently capped by the server.

Once everything is set up, try typing the following in your MCP-compatible chatbox:

```text
list all my repositories
```

## 🐛 Debugging

To enable debug mode, add the `-d` flag when running the Gitea MCP Server with http mode:

```sh
./gitea-mcp -t http [--port 8080] --token <your personal access token> -d
```

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, here are some common troubleshooting steps:

1. **Check your PATH**: Ensure that the `gitea-mcp` binary is in a directory included in your system's PATH.
2. **Verify dependencies**: Make sure you have all the required dependencies installed, such as `make` and `Golang`.
3. **Review configuration**: Double-check your MCP configuration file for any errors or missing information.
4. **Consult logs**: Check the logs for any error messages or warnings that can provide more information about the issue.
